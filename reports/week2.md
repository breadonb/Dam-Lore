# Team report

## Goals from a week ago 
--

## progress and issues
This week we came up with what we wanted to do with our project. We want to create a website
that allows users to discover more history about some sites OSU that are not on Google Maps.
We got suggestions from the TA that we can extend our content by adding places visitors could visit 
or restaurants that people should try. We came up with our website name and some simple design for our website.
We talked about how we could split into smaller groups to be in charge of different parts, and we could rotate responsibilities 
so people could have experience with other parts of the project. 

Issues we encountered was that we were unsure of the subjects we wanted to put on our websites. like restaurants, 
history sites, parks...etc. Another part is that should we find some places that have interesting stories and go interview people?
We have to think whether we have time to do this or not.  

## Goals
- Think of features(restaurants, history sites...etc) that should be included in the map (1/23)
      - Think of landmarks that we can add to the map (1/26)
- Split into smaller groups for different parts (1/23)
