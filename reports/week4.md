- Think of website design (1/27)
  

## progress and issues
This week we assigned people to different tasks. These tasks include creating basic pages(mission, tour page), 
interviewing culture centers at OSU, researching potential spots on our map, and switching from GitHub pages 
to class server (because of dynamics). We came into an agreement that we should get these basic things done to have 
our project move forward so we can do research stuff later. 


Issues we encountered were
