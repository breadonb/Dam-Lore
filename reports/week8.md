# Team report

## Goals from a week ago 
- Have a meeting and divide works (2/28)

## progress and issues
This week, we gathered up and divided our work. We have someone doing the map page. Two people are in charge of the tour page.
One person hosting the website on the engineering server, and one person is a UI tester. All the work should be done by next Tuesday 3/4. 
So we can have time to view the complete website and see if any changes should be made. 

The issue we encountered is that people in the group are not familiar with MongoDB and need some help to get familiar with it. 
Also some people did not show up at the meeting, so they may fall behind schedule. 

## Goals
- Set up map page (3/4)
- Itenory dynamic tours (3/4)
- publish/host website on the engineering server (3/4)
- UI test (3/4)
- Add info to history page (3/4)
